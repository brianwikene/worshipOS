# WorshipOS — Pastor FAQ

### Is this another Church Management System (ChMS)?
No. WorshipOS is not trying to replace a full ChMS. It focuses on worship, volunteers, teams, communication, and care—designed to grow carefully without becoming bloated or impersonal.

---

### Will this lock us into a rigid way of doing church?
No. WorshipOS is intentionally flexible. It does not force a single process, model, or structure. Churches can use what fits their context and ignore what doesn’t.

---

### What happens when plans change during a service?
Plans are preserved, and changes are recorded. WorshipOS does not rewrite Sundays. Spirit-led audibles are respected and documented without erasing preparation.

---

### Are people being tracked or scored?
Absolutely not. There are no volunteer scores, rankings, or performance metrics. Any patterns surfaced exist only to prompt pastoral check-ins, not judgment or pressure.

---

### Is this software trying to automate pastoral care?
No. WorshipOS never replaces relationships. It simply helps leaders notice patterns earlier so real conversations can happen sooner.

---

### What if we decide this isn’t right for us later?
Your data remains yours. WorshipOS is designed to be honest, portable, and respectful. If a church needs to transition away, it should be able to do so with dignity.

---

### Who is this best suited for?
Churches who value trust, clarity, and care—and who want tools that serve people without turning ministry into a machine.
