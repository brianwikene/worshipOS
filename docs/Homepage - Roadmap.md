# WorshipOS Roadmap  
### What We’re Building — and What We’re Not

WorshipOS is built slowly, on purpose.

This roadmap isn’t a list of features racing toward a deadline.  
It’s a statement of direction, discipline, and trust.

---

## How We Decide What to Build

Every feature must meet three criteria:

1. **Does it serve real church life, not just efficiency?**
2. **Does it protect trust, dignity, and integrity?**
3. **Does it align with our core design philosophy?**

If a feature doesn’t pass these tests, we don’t build it—even if it’s popular, requested, or easy.

## What We’re Building

### Foundation (Always First)
These are non-negotiable and ongoing:
- Hard church-level data isolation
- Clear, honest service history (“we don’t rewrite Sundays”)
- Simple, truthful language throughout the system
- Reliable workflows that leaders and volunteers can trust

Without these, nothing else matters.

---

### Worship & Service Planning
- Thoughtful planning tools for worship services
- Clear service lifecycle (draft → published → locked)
- Support for Spirit-led audibles without erasing preparation
- Honest records of what was planned and what actually happened

---

### Teams & Volunteers
- Scheduling that respects people’s time and limits
- Visibility that supports responsibility without pressure
- Tools that help teams coordinate without becoming transactional

---

### Soul Care (Built Carefully)
- Pattern awareness to help leaders notice burnout or disengagement
- Gentle prompts that encourage pastoral check-ins
- No scoring, ranking, or automated judgments
- Care-informed coordination that supports diaconal ministry

This will be built only when the data and foundations are trustworthy.

---

### Groups & Community (When Ready)
- Support for small groups and ministry teams
- Communication spaces for people already connected to the church
- Tools that strengthen belonging without replacing relationships

---

## What We’re Not Building

These are intentional non-goals.

### We Are Not Building:
- Volunteer performance scores or leaderboards
- Gamification or pressure-based incentives
- Predictive behavior or “risk scoring”
- Automated pastoral decisions
- Public dashboards that expose individual behavior
- One-size-fits-all church models
- Feature bloat added just to keep up with competitors

If a feature treats people like cogs, it doesn’t belong here.

---

## No Bolt-On Features

WorshipOS does not accept add-ons that contradict its design philosophy.

Every feature must:
- share the same language
- respect the same boundaries
- reinforce the same values

If something can’t be integrated honestly, it won’t be added.

---

## Can This Change?

Yes—with care.

WorshipOS may grow, adapt, or evolve as churches grow and contexts change.  
But if a direction ever compromises trust, integrity, or care, we choose restraint.

And if this project can no longer be built faithfully, it should be ended rather than diluted.

---

## In Short

WorshipOS is not trying to be everything.

It is trying to be:
- trustworthy
- humane
- disciplined
- helpful over the long haul

This roadmap reflects that commitment.
