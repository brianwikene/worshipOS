# WorshipOS Product Principles  
### For Contributors and Future Builders

This document exists to protect the heart of WorshipOS as it grows.

These principles are not preferences.
They are constraints.

If a contribution violates them, the contribution is wrong—even if it works.

---

## 1. Trust Is the Primary Feature

If users cannot trust the system,
no feature matters.

We optimize for:
- honesty over convenience
- clarity over cleverness
- safety over speed

Anything that quietly erodes trust is rejected.

---

## 2. We Don’t Rewrite Reality

Past events are preserved.
Changes are appended, not edited into the past.

The system must always be able to answer honestly:
- what was planned
- what happened
- who was responsible

Revisionist history is a bug.

---

## 3. Isolation Before Authorization

Churches are hard security boundaries.
Permissions never replace isolation.

If isolation is unclear, stop.
If authorization is complex, slow down.

Security and clarity are prerequisites, not enhancements.

---

## 4. Metrics Serve People, Not the Other Way Around

We do not score people.
We do not rank faithfulness.
We do not automate care.

Patterns may prompt attention.
Humans provide discernment.

Any metric that pressures, shames, or gamifies behavior is rejected.

---

## 5. No Dual Vocabulary

Every concept has one name.
Every name has one meaning.

If language drifts, bugs follow.
If bugs hide, trust erodes.

Clarity of language is a design requirement.

---

## 6. No Feature Without a Lifecycle

If something can be created,
it must have a clear lifecycle.

Draft → visible → locked is the default mental model.

Infinite editability is not a feature.
It is a liability.

---

## 7. Build Vertical, Not Wide

We build complete slices:
- data
- rules
- UI
- error states
- edge cases

Half-built features create confusion and debt.
Depth earns trust.

---

## 8. Avoid Cleverness

Clever systems are fragile.
Obvious systems are resilient.

Prefer boring solutions that tell the truth
over elegant solutions that confuse.

---

## 9. Humans Are Always the Authority

The system may suggest.
It may prompt.
It may remind.

It never decides spiritual outcomes.

If a feature replaces conversation,
it is not a WorshipOS feature.

---

## 10. If It Can’t Be Built Faithfully, Don’t Build It

There is no shame in restraint.
There is no virtue in shipping the wrong thing.

If a direction compromises:
- trust
- dignity
- care
- coherence

We stop.

---

## Final Note

WorshipOS is not neutral software.
It is shaped by theological, pastoral, and ethical commitments.

If you are building here,
you are stewarding more than code.

Build accordingly.
