# WorshipOS Constitution
## Foundational Principles for Formation, Care, and Truth

This document defines the non-negotiable principles that govern WorshipOS.
It exists to protect people from systems — including this one.

If a feature, workflow, or architectural decision contradicts this document,
the feature is wrong, not the people.

This constitution precedes implementation, metrics, and optimization.

---

## 1. People Live in Seasons, Not Stages

Life is not linear.

People move through seasons of:
- presence and absence
- leadership and support
- visibility and hiddenness
- capacity and constraint

Faithful participation may be synchronous or asynchronous.

Absence is not failure.
Asynchrony is not disengagement.

The system must not assume constant availability or visibility as faithfulness.

---

## 2. There Is a Diversity of Encounter With God

People encounter God in many ways, including (but not limited to):
- gathered worship
- quiet prayer
- caregiving and service
- creativity and art
- movement and embodiment
- generosity and hospitality
- attentiveness to others

No single practice is normative for all people at all times.

Uniform participation is not spiritual maturity.

---

## 3. Growth Is Formation, Not Progress

**Growth reflects formation and shared rhythms — not progress, performance, or qualification.**

Growth exists to help leaders remember shared formation, not to evaluate people.

Growth may record:
- participation in shared formation experiences
- dates of participation
- light contextual notes

Growth must never:
- unlock permissions
- gate leadership
- measure readiness
- rank or score people
- appear in public or member-facing contexts

Growth is memory, not measurement.

---

## 4. Tending Is Care, Not Control

**Tending is noticing, remembering, and responding with care.**

Tending implies:
- presence, not pressure
- attentiveness, not authority
- responsiveness, not control
- seasonality, not linear progress

Tending exists to support people, not manage them.

Tending may include:
- pastoral notes
- prayer requests
- care signals
- follow-up prompts
- coordination of care
- routing responsibility to relationally appropriate leaders

Tending must never become:
- surveillance
- behavioral monitoring
- compliance enforcement
- spiritual oversight of conscience

Responsibility flows toward leaders, not from people.

---

## 5. Tasks Serve Responsibility, Not Bureaucracy

Tasks exist only in context.

Tasks may originate from:
- Gatherings (preparation and planning)
- Tending (response to care signals)

Tasks must:
- be attached to a real situation
- carry human context
- be assignable by relationship and capacity

Tasks must never exist as a standalone productivity system.

---

## 6. Metrics Surface Context for Care

**Metrics are used to surface context for care — not to measure success, performance, or outcomes.**

Metrics should:
- prompt curiosity, not judgment
- highlight people, not numbers
- lead to questions, not conclusions

Metrics must never:
- rank people
- compare leaders
- determine worth or faithfulness
- imply spiritual health

If a metric cannot be traced back to real people and real events, it does not belong.

---

## 7. The System Never Lies

WorshipOS never invents, infers, smooths, or hallucinates data.

The system presents:
- only what has been explicitly recorded
- exactly as recorded
- with clear provenance

Unknown is more honest than guessed.

---

## 8. Append, Don’t Erase

WorshipOS is append-first.

- New information is added, not rewritten
- Corrections are recorded as corrections
- History is preserved

We augment data.
We do not rewrite the past.

---

## 9. Archive, Don’t Delete

Deletion is almost always a lie about history.

Records may be archived:
- removed from active use
- hidden from default views
- preserved as true

Hard deletion is reserved only for:
- explicit user request
- legal necessity
- data that never should have existed

Soft-delete is an ethical stance, not a technical shortcut.

---

## 10. Provenance Is Sacred

Every meaningful record should be able to answer:
- Who recorded this?
- When?
- In what context?
- From what source?

Memory without source becomes rumor.

---

## 11. Robust, Easy, Powerful, Contextual

WorshipOS must be:

- **Robust** — holds up under real life and incomplete data
- **Easy** — low cognitive load, minimal training
- **Powerful** — enables meaningful action
- **Contextual** — responds to seasons, roles, and relationships

If a feature improves one at the expense of the others, it must be reworked or rejected.

---

## Final Clause

We will not trade contextual care for organizational clarity.

If clarity requires flattening people’s lived reality,
clarity is the wrong goal.

---

If a feature contradicts this constitution,
the feature must change.
