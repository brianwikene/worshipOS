# DRAFT — Tending: Service Load Context & Follow-Up Prompts
*(Work in Progress — Not Finalized)*

> Status: Draft  
> This document reflects current thinking and is subject to revision.  
> It exists to explore posture, language, and mechanics — not to lock behavior.

## Purpose

This document describes how WorshipOS may surface **service load context** and create **follow-up prompts** without:
- blocking participation
- enforcing rest
- labeling risk
- overriding human discernment

The goal is attentiveness, not intervention.

---

## Foundational Commitments (Non-Negotiable)

This design is governed by the WorshipOS Constitution, including:

- People live in seasons, not stages  
- Metrics surface context for care, not success or performance  
- The system never lies and never guesses  
- Tending is presence, not pressure  

If any implementation contradicts these commitments, it must be revised.

---

## What the System May Observe (Facts Only)

The system may record and surface factual observations such as:

- Number of consecutive weeks a person has served
- Total services served within a time window
- Upcoming scheduled commitments
- Changes in participation patterns over time

These are **descriptive facts**, not interpretations.

The system must not:
- assign health states
- infer burnout
- label risk levels
- predict future behavior

---

## What the System Must Not Do

Under no circumstances may the system:

- block scheduling automatically
- prevent a person from serving
- require justification to participate
- escalate absence into obligation
- imply that rest or service is morally preferable

Human agency always supersedes automation.

---

## From Observation to Prompt (Optional, Human-Directed)

When certain factual thresholds are met (e.g., multiple consecutive weeks of service), the system *may* offer a **follow-up prompt**.

This prompt is not an alert.
It is not a warning.
It is not a requirement.

It is an invitation to attentiveness.

### Example Prompt (Internal)

> “Jordan has served the last 6 weeks in a row.  
> You may want to check in or confirm capacity.”

Key characteristics:
- neutral tone
- no urgency language
- no moral framing
- no automatic action

---

## Follow-Up as a Task (Not a Mandate)

A follow-up prompt may be converted into a **task** and assigned to a leader.

This task exists to support relationship, not compliance.

### Task Characteristics

- Clearly optional
- Assignable by role or relationship
- Includes factual context
- Never visible to the person being discussed
- Does not expire into escalation

Example task title:
> “Optional check-in re: recent service rhythm”

---

## Leader Agency: Snooze, Dismiss, or Respond

Leaders may:

- **Complete** the task with a note  
  (e.g., “Already aware — this is a temporary season.”)

- **Snooze** the task  
  (e.g., “Revisit after Easter.”)

- **Dismiss** the task with context  
  (e.g., “Jordan requested additional serving during this season.”)

All outcomes are recorded as **append-only notes**, preserving truth without forcing action.

The system assumes leaders may know things it does not.

## No Negative Consequences
