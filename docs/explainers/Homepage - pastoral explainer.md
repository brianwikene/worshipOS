**Software That Behaves the Way We Try to Lead**

WorshipOS is shaped by pastoral values. It helps churches plan well, respond faithfully, and care for people before burnout or fracture takes root.

We don’t rewrite Sundays.  
Audibles are respected, not punished.  
Metrics start conversations—people provide care.

The system supports leaders without replacing them, protects trust instead of creating pressure, and grows carefully or not at all.

This is software for the long obedience of church life.
