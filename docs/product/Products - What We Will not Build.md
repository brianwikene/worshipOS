# What We Will Not Build

This document outlines explicit non-goals for WorshipOS. These boundaries exist to protect trust, theology, and long-term product integrity.

## We Will Not Build Discipleship Pipelines

WorshipOS will not implement linear discipleship pathways such as:
- Stage-based maturity ladders
- Membership lifecycles
- Advancement pipelines
- Funnel-style formation tracking

Formation is contextual and relational, not sequential or hierarchical.

## We Will Not Measure Spiritual Maturity

WorshipOS will not:
- Score engagement
- Rank participation
- Infer growth
- Model calling or vocation
- Predict leadership readiness

These realities are discerned in community, not computed.

## We Will Not Turn Formation Into Credentials

We will not:
- Issue badges or achievements
- Display formation publicly
- Gamify participation
- Use formation as a proxy for trust

Formation supports service; it does not confer status.

## We Will Not Centralize Authority in Software

WorshipOS will not:
- Auto-approve leaders
- Replace pastoral judgment
- Override relational discernment
- Treat software permissions as spiritual authority

The system supports leaders; it does not lead people.

## We Will Not Track People Without Consent

WorshipOS will not:
- Track individual worship attendance
- Create hidden engagement profiles
- Harvest contact data through coercion
- Automate follow-up without explicit opt-in

Trust is assumed, protected, and reversible.

## Summary

If a proposed feature treats people as inputs, progress as throughput, or formation as manufacture—it does not belong in WorshipOS.
