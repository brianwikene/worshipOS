# WorshipOS Documentation

This folder contains the philosophical, theological, architectural, and product foundations of WorshipOS.

These documents exist to preserve **intent**, not just implementation.
They are here so future contributors — and future Brian — do not have to reconstruct *why* decisions were made.

If code and documentation disagree, the code is wrong.

## What This Documentation Is

This is not a feature list.  
This is not marketing copy.  
This is not speculative design.

These documents define:
- the convictions that shape the product
- the boundaries that protect trust and care
- the architectural decisions that enforce those boundaries
- the features we will build — and the ones we will not

WorshipOS is not neutral software.
It encodes pastoral, theological, and ethical commitments.

## Start Here (Required Reading)

### 🧭 The Constitution (North Star)

**`constitution/WorshipOS_Constitution.md`**

This is the highest-order document in the system.

It defines:
- how we understand people, seasons, and formation
- what Growth is and is not
- what Tending is and is not
- how metrics may be used (and how they may not)
- how truth, memory, and history are preserved

If a decision contradicts the Constitution, the decision must change.

## How This Documentation Is Organized

The documents in this folder fall into a few broad categories.
They are meant to be read *in relationship*, not isolation.

### 🏛 Architecture & Guarantees
Hard promises the system makes and must keep.

Includes:
- tenancy and security boundaries
- visibility rules
- formation access constraints
- future authentication assumptions

Examples:
- `WorshipOS_Tenancy_and_Architecture_Promises.md`
- `Architecture - Formation Visibility.md`
- `Architecture - WorshipOS.md`

---

### 🌱 Philosophy & Pastoral Grounding
Why the system behaves the way it does.

Includes:
- formation vs performance
- soul care vs control
- digital deacon concepts
- restraint as faithfulness

Examples:
- `philosophy - formation and trust.md`
- `Soul Care & the Digital Deacon.md`
- `Quiet Positioning - Coordination and Care.md`

---

### 🧭 Product Principles & Boundaries
What we will build — and what we intentionally refuse to build.

Includes:
- non-goals
- locked services
- product restraint
- contributor guardrails

Examples:
- `Products - What We Will not Build.md`
- `Founders Note - Why we Say No.md`
- `Internal - Product Principles - (Future Contributors).md`

---

### 🗺 Roadmaps & Direction
Forward-looking documents that are *directional*, not contractual.

Includes:
- soul care readiness
- feature sequencing
- long-horizon thinking

Examples:
- `Homepage - Roadmap.md`
- `soul-care-roadmap.md`
- `Architecture Supplement - Soul Care Readiness & Roadmap.md`

---

### 📖 Explainers & FAQs
Documents written to help humans understand intent and usage.

Includes:
- pastoral explainers
- FAQs
- homepage drafts
- narrative summaries

Examples:
- `Explainer - Pastoral.md`
- `FAQ - Formation and Leadership.md`
- `Homepage - pastoral explainer.md`

## How to Read This Folder (Suggested Order)

1. **The Constitution** — non-negotiable principles
2. **Architecture & Tenancy** — what must always be true
3. **Philosophy & Pastoral Grounding** — why it exists
4. **Product Principles & “Why We Say No”** — restraint and boundaries
5. **Roadmaps** — where we are headed (and where we are not)
6. **Explainers & FAQs** — how to talk about it clearly

You do not need to read everything at once.
But you should never design or build in isolation from these ideas.

---

## Core Commitments (Summary)

WorshipOS is built on these commitments:

- People live in seasons, not stages
- There is a diversity of encounter with God
- Growth reflects formation, not qualification
- Tending is care, not control
- Metrics surface context, not success
- Tasks serve responsibility, not bureaucracy
- Truth is preserved, not polished
- History is appended, not erased
- Robust, easy, powerful, and contextual are all required — not tradeoffs

---

## Final Note

This documentation exists to protect people from systems — including this one.

If a feature requires:
- flattening lived reality
- guessing instead of knowing
- deleting history for convenience
- optimizing people for metrics

…then the feature is wrong.

This folder is here to make that clear before a single line of code is written.
