# WorshipOS Documentation

This folder contains the philosophical, theological, and architectural foundations of WorshipOS.

These documents exist to preserve **intent**, not just implementation.
They are here so future contributors—and future Brian—do not have to reconstruct why decisions were made.

---

## What This Documentation Is

This is not a feature list.
This is not marketing copy.
This is not speculative design.

These documents define:
- the values that shape the product
- the boundaries that protect trust
- the architectural decisions that enforce those values
- the features we will build—and the ones we will not

If an implementation conflicts with these documents, the implementation is wrong.

## How to Read This Folder

These documents are meant to be read together.

Suggested order:
1. **Architecture & Tenancy** — the hard guarantees
2. **Kingdom Expectation & Locked Services** — truthful history
3. **Soul Care & Digital Deacon Philosophy** — pastoral intent
4. **Roadmap** — what we are building and refusing to build
5. **Why We Say No** — restraint as faithfulness
6. **Product Principles** — guardrails for contributors

Each document reinforces the others.

## Who This Is For

- Pastors and church leaders seeking trust and clarity
- Technical contributors responsible for implementation
- Designers and product thinkers shaping UX
- Future maintainers stewarding the system over time

This documentation assumes good faith, intelligence, and care.

---

## Core Commitments (Summary)

WorshipOS is built on these commitments:
- Churches are hard security boundaries.
- History is preserved, not rewritten.
- People are cared for, not optimized.
- Metrics prompt conversation, not judgment.
- Automation never replaces discernment.
- Growth is slow, intentional, and reversible.

## Final Note

WorshipOS is not neutral software.
It encodes theological, pastoral, and ethical commitments.

This documentation exists to keep those commitments intact.
