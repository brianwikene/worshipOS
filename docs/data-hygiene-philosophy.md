# WorshipOS Data Hygiene & Review Philosophy

## Why Manual Review Matters

The system intentionally does NOT automatically inactivate people because:

### 1. Pastoral Awareness Over Automation
- Leaders need to know when someone has drifted away
- The absence itself is information worth noting and acting on
- Automated cleanup would hide patterns that matter pastorally

### 2. Relationship Context
- Someone might be inactive in one area but active in another
- Life seasons (new baby, illness, travel) create temporary gaps
- The system doesn't know the "why" - only people do

### 3. Data Integrity
- Historical records remain intact and meaningful
- Reporting stays accurate ("We had 12 team members, 3 have become inactive")
- No accidental loss of important context

## What the System Provides Instead

### Review Tools
- Configurable inactivity thresholds per ministry/team
- Smart alerts when someone crosses those thresholds
- Bulk review interfaces for efficient processing
- Context at a glance: last active date, last contact, related ministries

### Suggested Actions
- "Mark as inactive" (with optional reason/notes)
- "Contact for check-in" (creates a pastoral to-do)
- "Extend grace period" (for known temporary situations)
- "Keep active" (if there's context the system doesn't see)

## Best Practices

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly or quarterly reviews of potential inactives
- End-of-season cleanup for seasonal teams
- Annual "spring cleaning" for entire database

### Communication First
- Use inactivity notices as prompts to reach out
- Document outcomes of those conversations
- Consider reactivation pathways

### Graceful Transitions
- When marking inactive, add notes about why/context
- Maintain relationship even when removing from active roster
- Make reactivation easy when circumstances change
